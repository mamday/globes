GLoBES - General Long Baseline Experiment Simulator
===================================================

This is GLoBES, a collection of numerical routines for the simulation
and analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments.

Limitations
===========

GLoBES is *not* thread safe.
GLoBES is *not* designed to be used in *security critical* applications 
and environments, e.g. no care has been taken to avoid vulnerability
to heap corruption exploits etc.

Credit

GLoBES is mainly developed for academic use. Thus the authors would
appreciate being given academic credit for it. Whenever you use GLoBES
to produce a publication or a talk indicate that you have used GLoBES and
please cite the following references:

Besides, many of the data which is used by GLoBES and distributed together
with it should be correctly referenced where possible. For details see the
documentation.

Availability
============

The current stable version of GLoBES as well as the manual is always available
from http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/~globes/

Installation
============

GLoBES follows the standard GNU installation procedure.  Please consult
the INSTALL file in this distribution for more detailed instructions.

For information about specific platforms and compilers see the
"Compilation Notes" section in the INSTALL file.

More information about GLoBES
=============================

The project homepage is http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/~globes/

See the NEWS file for recent changes to the library.

Reporting Bugs
==============

A list of known bugs can be found in the BUGS file.  
Details of compilation problems can be found in the INSTALL file.

If you find a bug which is not listed in these files please report it
to <globes@mpi-hd.mpg.de>.

All bug reports should include:

       The version number of GLoBES, and where you obtained it.
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used, including version number and compilation options
       A description of the bug behaviour
       A short program which reproducibly exercises the bug

It is also useful if you can report whether the same problem occurs
when the library is compiled without optimization.

Thank you.
