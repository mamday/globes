**********Version 3.0.1

18/01/2007 JK
        - Updated copyright notices in all code files
        - Included title of new paper in README
        - Removed #include <ltdl.h> from globes.c

**********Version 3.0.2

18/01/2007 MR
        - glb_fluxes.c modified: now contains exact beta beam spectrum
                -> no normalization factor needed any more
        - BBvar_WC.glb and BBvar_TASD.glb modified accordingly
        - T2K.glb now has same @norm as T2HK.glb (matches Table 1, hep-ph/0204352)

**********Version 3.0.4

19/01/2007 PH
        - fixed a bug in the defintions parser of globes.c

**********Version 3.0.5

23/01/2007 JK
        - Added hep-ph number of new paper to README
        - Fixed minor problem which occurred for duplicate channel definitions


**********Version 3.0.6

23/01/2007 PH
	- Added a distcheck-hook which tests the md5-sums file in data 

**********Version 3.0.7

25/01/2007 PH
	- the configury now handles --disable-rpath correctly, which
	is what should be used on Mac OS X. Updated to libool 1.5.22
	and autoconf 2.59.

	- undefined AEDL variables are no longer defaulting to zero
	but to NaN, which ensures that they create an ERROR

25/01/2007 JK
        - Corrected correlated flux normalization in D-Chooz_far.glb
          from 2.0% to 2.8%

**********Version 3.0.8

29/03/2007 JK
        - Corrected a bug in the glb_likelihood: In the calculation
          of the Poisson chi^2, the "true" and fitted rates were
          exchanged. This has a visible effect only for very small
          event rates.

17/04/2007 JK
        - Fixed a small bug in glbDefaultExp, leading to a possible read
          beyond array boundaries of smear_data[0]->bin_center 


**********Version 3.0.9

24/05/2007 PH
	- Fixed BUG#18

**********Version 3.0.10
29/06/2007 JK
        - Fixed another potential problem in glb_likelihood (chi^2 could
          become negative for true_rate=0, fit_rate<0)
        - Fixed problem in glbShiftEnergyScale: for negative shifts, the
          leftmost bin was always set to 0, instead of some interpolation
          between 0 and its original value. This is not a big problem, but
          it leads to glb_likelihood returning 1e200, which can confuse
          the minimizer if it happens in the very first evaluation of chi^2.
        - Added DocPlots.nb to the distribution

**********Version 3.0.11
13/09/2007 JK
        - Removed libstdc++ from Makefile in source directory
        - Declared fa, fb, fc and fu as long double in glb_hybrid_bracket
          to avoid problems with extra floating point digits on x86 CPUs
          (in the case of flat directions in parameter space, comparisons
          could yield wrong results if the operands were identical, but
          one of them was stored in main memory while the other was retained
          in the floating point registers). See also http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/,
          entryg No. #323.
